BASICS
############################################
The goal of Oxalic is to be a simple
programming language, with a simple
syntax, for simple programs. 

Oxalic only has four key--tokens,
(A key-token being a keyword but with
symbols only, Oxalic has a few tokens).
The key-tokens are:
@  - Get user input
#  - Print
?  - If
&  - Return

These are the only four needed to make
a functional programminglanguage.
